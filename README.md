This repository started life back in 2011 as a collection of configuration
files that I wanted to keep in version control. Since then, it has expanded
into a fairly complete Ansible-based operations automation system for all of
the machines and services that I manage. Targets include both physical and
virtual machines running Debian GNU/Linux and Apple macOS.

I make no guarantees that any of this code will be directly useful to anyone
else, but feel free to have a look if you like configuration files or
Ansible roles.
